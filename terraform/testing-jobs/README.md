## Locals
The following locals are configured as an Inputs to the testing-job terraform code, if required can be modified.

```
vpc_name                      = "main"
kms_key_id                    = data.aws_ssm_parameter.kms_data_default.value
aws_codebuild_project_arn     = "arn:aws:codebuild:${data.aws_region.current.name}:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:project/${module.build.codebuild_project.name}"
pipeline_artifact_bucket_name = data.aws_ssm_parameter.codepipeline_artifact_store.value
pipeline_artifact_bucket_arn  = "arn:aws:s3:::${local.pipeline_artifact_bucket_name}"
name                          = terraform.workspace
aws_codecommit_repo_arn       = "arn:aws:codecommit:${data.aws_region.current.name}:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:${var.repository_name}"
selenium_browser              = "*chrome"
test_execution_mode           = "headless"

The following locals are configured as an Inputs mapping to each spcific testing-job terraform code, which needs modification.

````
inputs = {
  "default" = {
    codecommit_branch     = "development"
    PollForSourceChanges  = true
    execution_folder      = "pi-integration-platform-acceptance"
    test_environment      = "demo"
    suite_xml             = "integration-platform-acceptance.xml"
    build_timeout         = 240 #Number of minutes, from 5 to 480. Default value is 60 mins
    queued_timeout        = 480 #Number of minutes, from 5 to 480. Default value is 480 mins
    maven_parameter       = "mvn -U clean install"
    google_chrome_version = "93.0.4577.82-1"
    chrome_driver_version = "92.0.4515.107"
    cron_shedule          = "cron(10 6 ? * 3 *)"
  }
}

## Usage
This requires Terraform version 1.0.3 and above.

The repository is set up to substitute the current workspace name as the testing job purpose. So, make sure that the Terraform workspace by the testing job purpose is created and the selected workspace is the one whose name is the same as the defined testing job purpose.  
Example:
```
locals {
  valid_workspaces = {
    demo-integrations2-acceptance = "demo-integrations2-acceptance"
  }
  selected_workspace = local.valid_workspaces[terraform.workspace]
}
```

Copy the <demo-integrations2-acceptance> section from the locals.tf file (also copied in the above section) & paste it by changing it to supported <testing job purpose> as described in the workspace.tf also in above section. Fill in all the required information for the new testing job.

### Switching terraform workspace
For example, if the name of the testing job purpose is 'demo-integrations2-acceptance' & the workspace is not exits, then create a workspace named `demo-integrations2-acceptance`
```
terraform workspace new demo-integrations2-acceptance
```
List the current available workspace & identify the selected workspace by symbol '*' in front of workspace name
```
terraform workspace list
```
Select 'demo-integrations2-acceptance' as the current workspace, if not already
```
terraform workspace select demo-integrations2-acceptance
```

Additionally, some parameter defaults are set specifically set for specific testing job purpose/regions(for pxp-build, restricted to us-east-2).
Go through the locals section above to understand the various local reference for execution and update accordingly.  

Using the configurations is easy. Run the following commands from within the `terraform/testing-jobs/` directory:
```
terraform init
```
Create a plan
```
terraform plan -no-color -out=pipeline.tfplan
```
Review the generated plan and once satisfied execute it using the `terraform apply` command
```
terraform apply pipeline.tfplan
```
