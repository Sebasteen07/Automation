# PxP QA CodePipeline - jobs with dependencies

## Overview
This directory contains Terraform configurations to create a dependency-jobs via AWS CodePipeline for PxP QA CodePipeline.

## Pre-requisites
The following resources must be created using the `common` folder
  - CodeCommit repository `qa-automation-mirror` for mirroring the [qa-automation](https://bitbucket.nextgen.com/projects/MFQA/repos/qa-automation/browse) repo from Bitbucket
  - KMS keys ARN stored in SSM parameter - `/nextgen/kms/data/default` for data encryption key
  - Bucket ARN stored in SSM parameter - `/nextgen/codepipeline/artifact-store/default` for storing CodePipeline artifacts & logs
  - AWS Chatbot channel for Slack notifications

## Terraform versions
### Recommended
- Terraform v 1.0.0 and above  
- AWS Provider v 3.59.0 and above

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| qa_automation_utils_rel_codebuild_project_role | The codebuild project role for git-maven-build-qa-automation-utils-rel |
| qa_automation_utils_rel_codepipeline_name | The codepipeline id created for test execution of git-maven-build-qa-automation-utils-rel |
| qa_automation_utils_rel_cloudwatch_event_rule_name | Cloudwatch event rule name created for triggering pipeline execution of git-maven-build-qa-automation-utils-rel |

## Locals
The following locals are configured as an Inputs to the testing-job terraform code, if required can be modified.

```
vpc_name                      = "main"
kms_key_id                    = data.aws_ssm_parameter.kms_data_default.value
pipeline_artifact_bucket_name = data.aws_ssm_parameter.codepipeline_artifact_store.value
pipeline_artifact_bucket_arn  = "arn:aws:s3:::${local.pipeline_artifact_bucket_name}"
````

The following locals are configured as an Inputs mapping to each specific dependency-job terraform code, which needs modification.

For example, the job git-maven-build-qa-automation-utils-rel implemented by `git-maven-build-qa-automation-utils-rel.tf` has the following inputs that are defined in the `locals.tf`:

```
qa_automation_utils_rel = {
    name                  = "git-maven-build-qa-automation-utils-rel"
    codecommit_branch     = "master"
    PollForSourceChanges  = true
    git_tag_name          = "master"
    execution_folder      = "qa-automation-utils"
    maven_test_skip       = "true"
    build_timeout         = 240
    queued_timeout        = 480
    maven_parameter       = "mvn clean install"
}
```
Similarly, adding new jobs would need the corresponding inputs to be added in the `local.tf` as well.

## Usage
This requires Terraform version 1.0.0 and above.

Go through the locals section above to understand the various local reference for execution and update accordingly.  

For using the configurations run the following commands from within the `terraform/testing-jobs/` directory:
```
terraform init
```
Create a plan
```
terraform plan -no-color -out=terraform.plan | tee terraform.plan.log
```
Review the generated plan `terraform.plan.log` and once satisfied that it is creating/modifying only intended resources, execute it using the `terraform apply` command
```
terraform apply terraform.plan
```
